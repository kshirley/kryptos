1. Vigenere cipher just like K1-K2; scrabble dictionary; "KRYPTOS" as alphabet
   n = 178,691
   - rejected using bigram log-likelihood

2. Transposition cipher just like K3; single or double columnar transposition, padded to 98
   n = 11 (13, but two are redundant)
   - rejected using bigram log-likelihood, also using frequency log-likelihood

3. Transposition cipher followed by a Vigenere(list = scrabble dictionary, alphabet = "KRYPTOS")
   n = 178,691
   - rejected using frequency log-likelihood (no transpositions checked)

4. Vigenere(list = scrabble, alphabet = "KRYPTOS"), followed by a single or double columnar transposition padded to 98.
   n = 178,691 * 11  (13 possible factors of 98 (4 + 9) but two are redundant)
   - rejected using bigram log-likelihood

5. Running key from 97 consecutive characters in K1-K3 (no question marks), index offset by 0, 1, 2, ..., 25, additive encoding.
   n = 17,472
   - rejected using bigram and frequency log-likelihood

6. Running key from 97 consecutive characters in K1-K3 (no question marks), Vigenere encoding (alphabet = "KRYPTOS" or "A-Z")
   n = 672 * 2 = 1344






Questions:
- How do we 'extract' a running key from the ciphertext of K1-K3?
- After we have a running key of length 97, how do we encode/decode the text? (Additive? Vigenere? Something else?)

The length-97 key doesn't seem to be a block of consecutive characters.

Some other possibilities:
- columnar transposition
- route transposition (see arrows in the encoding charts)
- some sequence of indices given by a keyword like "KRYPTOS" (maybe some sort of fibonnaci sequence?)
- some sequence of indices keyed by the encoding errors that Sanborn made (which he claims are intentional and important)

encoding errors:
"K" is the 57th character, and is a coding error (out of 63 characters in the first message).
"R" is the 179th character, and is a coding error.
"R" is the 116th character out of 372 characters in the second message.
